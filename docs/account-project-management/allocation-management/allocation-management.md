# Managing Your Allocations
Allocations require management â€“ balance checks, resource allocation, requesting more time, etc.

## Checking for an Active Allocation
To determine if there is an active allocation, check [Job Submision](../../../theta/queueing-and-running-jobs/job-and-queue-scheduling/#submit-a-job).

For information how how to run the query, look at our documentation on our [sbank Allocations Accounting System](sbank-allocation-accounting-system.md) or email [support@alcf.anl.gov](mailto:support@alcf.anl.gov) and ask for all active allocations.

## Using sbank to Determine the Balance of an Allocation
To determine which platforms have an active balance, check our allocation accounting system [sbank](sbank-allocation-accounting-system.md).

- To obtain the allocation balance, check the sbank command [sbank-list-allocations](sbank-list-allocations.md).
- DD projects with a negative balance will not be able to run jobs until they have requested additional time, see Getting more time below.
- INCITE and ALCC PIs automatically email a summary of project usage.  If this is a DD project, please email [support@alcf.anl.gov](mailto:support@alcf.anl.gov).

## Allocation Expiration
Projects and allocations at the ALCF are different.  A particular project might have multiple allocations of time. For example, a discretionary project that has been approved for more than 3 times will have 3 allocations (2 are probably expired) but just one project. Projects will not expire, allocations will. If allocations are expired, or have no hours left, jobs will not be able to run. Use the two bullets above (Checking for an active allocation and Determining the balance of an allocation) to determine active allocations.

## Getting More Time
To request an extension of your existing discretionary allocation or to request additional hours, please email [support@alcf.anl.gov](mailto:support@alcf.anl.gov) with answers to the following:

- What you have accomplished with your original allocation?
-   Please include a brief description of any publications or major presentations that were (or will be) generated in full or in part because of this allocation.
- What you will do with the extra time?
- What you are requesting as your new expiration date?
- How many additional hours you are requesting?
